Welcome to FitEgo! This document will serve as a developer guide to the all-in-one scheduling application. This is to encourage and guide interested parties who wish to extend FitEgo and improve its features.

Made with **fitness instructors** in mind, **FitEgo** is a **desktop program** that helps them **manage their clients and schedules**, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, **FitEgo** can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#26-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#22-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#23-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#24-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#25-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `cdel 1`.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2 UI component

    <p>
        <img src="images/UiClassDiagramP3.png" style="width: 50%"/>
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure 4a - UI Class Diagram (High Level) </figcaption>
</figure>

The UiComponents package in the above diagram has the following classes. 

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
    <p>
        <img src="images/UiClassDiagramP2.png"/>
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure 4b - UI Class Diagram - UiComponents package </figcaption>
</figure>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `Homepage` etc, as shown in Figure 4b above. 
All of these subcomponents are part of the UiComponents package, and each part make up the entire GUI. 
Every class within the `UiComponents` package, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UIComponents` uses JavaFx and ControlsFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component interacts with these external API: 

* `Logic` : Performs the Execution of user's commands.
* `Model` : Listens for changes to data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 2.3 Logic component

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
    <p>
        <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png"/>
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure 5 - Logic Component Class Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. deleting a Client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("cdel 1")` API call.

    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure 8 - Model Component Class Diagram - continued</figcaption>
</figure>

The figure above gives a more detailed class diagram for each of the Client, Session and Schedule packages.

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.



### 2.5 Storage component

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
    <p>
        <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png"/>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

## 3 **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels 
and logging destinations.

- The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file 
(See [Section 3.2](#32-configuration), “Configuration”)
- The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according 
to the specified logging level
- Currently log messages are output through both `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

- **SEVERE** : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
- **WARNING** : Can continue, but with caution
- **INFO** : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
- **FINE** : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging 
e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size


### 3.2 Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled(e.g. user prefs file location, logging level), 
through the configuration file (default: `config.json`)

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

### 3.3 Edit Session feature

<div id="f10" >The Edit Session feature allows user to edit a Session.</div>

#### 3.3.1 Implementation

The proposed Edit Session mechanism is facilitated by `Addressbook`.

These operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setSession()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Edit Session mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial client, session and schedule list.

Step 2. The user executes `sedit 1 g/coolgym` command to edit the first Session in the address book. 
The `sedit` command calls `Model#setSession()`, causing changes to be made in the Session List after the `sedit 1 g/coolgym` command executes.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Edit Session operation works:

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
    <p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EditSessionCommand` and `EditSessionCommandParser` should both end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `EditSession` command, with the assumption that the user inputs a valid command:

    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure 11 - Edit Session Activity Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

### 3.4 Delete Session feature

The Delete Session feature allows user to cancel a session, and delete all schedules associated to the session.

#### 3.4.1 Implementation

The Delete Session mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteSessionCommand` which extends `Command`. The format of the 
command is given by: 

```sdel INDEX [f/]```

When using this command, the `INDEX` should refer to the index shown in the Session List on the right panel.
By default, the command will not delete the session if there are schedules associated to the session. 
However, the user can pass in an optional force (`f/`) parameter to delete all schedules associated to the session.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `DeleteSession` command, with the assumption that the user inputs a valid command.

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
    <p>

    </p>

</figure>

The following diagram shows a possible application state in FitEgo, where 2 clients, Andy and John, are scheduled to a same session.

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
    <p>

    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure 13 - A possible application state</figcaption>
</figure>

In the following sequence diagram, we trace the execution when the user decides to enter the Delete Session command 
`sdel 1 f/` into FitEgo with the above application state, where the first session in the Session List is the "enduranceTraining" session. 
For simplicity, we will refer to this command input as `commandText`. 

<figure id="f14" style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
    <p>
        <img src="images/DeleteSessionSequenceDiagram.png"/>
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure 14 - Delete Session Sequence Diagram</figcaption>

    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure 15 - Delete Session Parse Args Ref Sequence Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>
 
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteSessionCommand` and `DeleteSessionCommandParser` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The sequence diagram above shows how the `DeleteSessionCommand` is executed in FitEgo. The `LogicManager` receives user 
command as commandText and parses it with `AddressBookParser`. It will parse the command and pass the remaining
arguments to `DeleteSessionCommandParser` to construct a `DeleteSessionCommand`. This `DeleteSessionCommand` is 
returned to the `LogicManager` which will then executes it with reference to the model argument.

The model will first get the current `FilteredSessionList` instance to get the session to be deleted. It will then check
whether there exist any schedule associated to the session. As there are currently 2 schedules associated to the "enduranceTraining" session in FitEgo and the boolean `isForced` 
is set to true, the model will remove them from `AddressBook`. It will then create a `CommandResult` to relay feedback 
message back to the UI and return control back to `LogicManager`. It will persist these changes by saving the addressbook to the storage.

#### 3.4.2 Design Considerations

In designing this feature, we had to consider several alternative ways in which we can choose to handle session deletion.

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete session only after all associated schedules are deleted.
    - Pros: 
        1. Easier to maintain data integrity.
    - Cons:
        1. Extra logic inside the method implementation.
        2. May have performance issues in terms of response time if there are a lot of schedules or sessions stored in FitEgo.
    
- **Alternative 2:** Mark session as deleted and treat schedules with deleted session as invalid
    - Pros: 
        1. Easier to implement the method. 
        2. No need to handle additional force flag option.
    - Cons: 
        1. We must keep track of deleted sessions, which might bloat up the application over time.
        2. Harder to maintain data integrity over time.
        
- **Alternative 3:** Delete the session without checking for associated schedules
    - Pros: Easy to implement.
    - Cons: A schedule might have invalid session, breaking data integrity.

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

### 3.5 Add Schedule feature

The Add Schedule feature allows user to create a Schedule associated with a Client and a Session. 
In other words, it allows user to schedule a Client to a Session.

#### 3.5.1 Implementation

The Add Schedule mechanism is facilitated by `AddScheduleCommand` which extends `Command`. The format of the 
command is given by: 

```schadd c/CLIENT_INDEX s/SESSION_INDEX```

When using this command, the `CLIENT_INDEX` should refer to the index shown in the Client List on the left panel, and is used to specify the Client. The `SESSION_INDEX` should refer to the index shown in the Session List on the right panel, and is used to specify the Session.

The following activity diagram summarizes the decision making process when a user executes a new `AddSchedule` command.

 <figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
     <p>
         <img src="images/AddScheduleActivityDiagram.png" style="width: 70%; height: auto;"/>
     </p>
     <figcaption>Figure 16 - Add Schedule Activity Diagram</figcaption>
 </figure>

#### 3.5.2 Command Usage Examples

Assume the current state of the displayed Client List, displayed Session List, and Schedules (all Schedules in FitEgo) are as illustrated in the following simplified object diagram:

 <figure id="f17" style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
     <p>
         <img src="images/OverlappingScheduleObjectDiagram0.png" style="width: 85%; height: auto;"/>
     </p>
     <figcaption>Figure 17 - Sample current state of Add Schedule</figcaption>
 </figure>

Now, consider two cases of Add Schedule command to be invoked.

**Case 1**:  `schadd c/2 s/1`

Here is what happens when `schadd c/2 s/1` is invoked.

To some extent, the mechanism (on how it involves `LogicManager`, `AddressBookParser`, and saving the changes to `Storage`) is similar to that of [Delete Session](#34-delete-session-feature), as illustrated in [its sequence diagram](#f14). The main differences are on the method call `parseCommand()` and `DeleteSessionCommand#execute(model)`.

`parseCommand()` method call:
Instead of using `DeleteSessionCommandParser`, it uses `AddScheduleCommandParser` to parse the argument `c/2 s/1` such that it returns an `AddScheduleCommand` object called `a` with Client index `2` and Session index `1`.

`AddScheduleCommand#execute(model)` will be called instead of `DeleteSessionCommand#execute(model)`. For this particular case, the method call `AddScheduleCommand#execute(model)` can be traced using the following sequence diagram snippet.

 <figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
     <p>
         <img src="images/AddScheduleExecuteRef.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
     </p>
     <figcaption>Figure 18 - Sequence diagram snippet for <code>AddScheduleCommand#execute(model)</code></figcaption>
 </figure>
 
As shown in the figure above, first it gets the Client and Session from the filtered (displayed) lists. Then, it checks for existing identical Schedule (Schedule that consists of the same Client and Session) using `hasAnyScheduleAssociatedWithClientAndSession()`. 
Since for this case no identical Schedule is not found, a new Schedule object is created and added into the Model using `Model#addSchedule()`. Finally, it returns the CommandResult to indicate a success.

Thus, `schadd c/2 s/1` will add a Schedule associated with Andy (the second Client in the Client List) and endurance training from 12/02/2020 1400 - 1600 (the first Session in the Session List). The result can be illustrated by the following object diagram, which shows a new Schedule is created.

 <figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
     <p>
         <img src="images/OverlappingScheduleObjectDiagram1.png" style="width: 85%; height: auto;"/>
     </p>
     <figcaption>Figure 19 - Result of invoking <code>schadd c/2 s/1</code></figcaption>
 </figure>

**Case 2:** `schadd c/1 s/1`

On the other hand, invoking `schadd c/1 s/1` will result in an error shown to the user as an identical Schedule already exists. [Here](#f17), John is already scheduled to the endurance training Session from 12/02/2020 1400 - 1600.

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

### 3.6 Edit Schedule feature

The Edit Schedule feature allows user to edit a Schedule that is associated with a Client and a Session.

#### 3.6.1 Implementation

The proposed Edit Schedule mechanism is facilitated by `Addressbook`, similar to the [Edit Session Command](#33-edit-session-feature).

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setSchedule()`.

Similar to the Edit Session mechanism, the example usage scenario below shows how Edit Schedule mechanism behaves:

The user executes `schedit c/1 s/1 us/2` command to edit the Schedule with the first Session and first Client in the address book. 
The `schedit` command calls `Model#setSchedule()`, causing changes to be made in the address book after the `schedit c/1 s/1 us/2` command executes, meaning that the Schedule is now associated with the second Session.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `EditSchedule` command, with the assumption that the user inputs a valid command:

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
    <p>
        <img src="images/EditScheduleActivityDiagram.png" style="width: 25%; height: auto;"/>
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure 20 - Edit Schedule Activity Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

#### 3.6.2 Design considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Retrieve Schedule using Client and Session Index.
  * Pros: Clearer to retrieve.
  * Cons: Require user to know the Client and Session Index separately.

* **Alternative 2:** Retrieve Schedule using Schedule Index
  itself.
  * Pros: Easier to retrieve.
  * Cons: Implementation is more confusing as User there's a conflict between Index and user-typed String index.

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

### 3.7 View Client's Weight feature

The viewing of client's weight feature allows the user to check in on a Client's progress after multiple Sessions.
This data is important because it allows the user to check the effectiveness of his training schedule and customise the training 
based on the remarks and weight progress. 

Viewing of Client's Weight is accessible when the user calls `cview [INDEX]` followed by activating the `Weight` tab pane. 

#### 3.7.1 Implementation

The recording of weight is stored in `Schedule` class. This is because we believe that trainer would optionally take a weight measurement
at the start of every session. Thus, to get the weight change over time, a list of schedules related to the `Client` has to be extracted. 

In the following sequence diagram, we trace the execution starting from when the user calls `cview 1` until when the UI is updated with Client View.

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
    <p>
        <img src="images/ClientViewWeightSequenceDiagram.png" alt="ClientViewWeightSequenceDiagram" style="align-content: center" />

    <figcaption>Figure 21 - Client View Weight Generate Sequence Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 

:information_source: **Note:**

The steps used to create CommandResult is omitted in the sequence diagram for clarity of diagram. The return object of `logic.execute("cview 1")`
is a CommandResult object, within which, contains a Supplier which returns a Pane for MainWindow to display when activated.

</div>

As shown in the "alt" frame, the chart is added into the tab pane if there are associated schedule and the weight (if present within the `Schedule` object)
will be added into the line chart. Otherwise, the `Weight` tab will be removed instead of showing an empty chart.  

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

#### 3.7.2 Design Considerations
In designing this weight tracking feature, we had considered several alternative ways in which we can store and retreive the weight. 

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the `Weight` within the `Schedule` object
  * Pros: The user can track the weight against each session attended. 
  * Cons: Multiple weight measurement during a session, and weight measurement without a session cannot be entered. 
  
* **Alternative 2:** Stores a list of `Weight` within the `Client` object
  * Pros: Do not require a schedule in order to track weight. 
  * Cons: Lesser information about the weight (schedule's exercise, remarks, time, etc) is stored.  

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

### 3.8 View Session by period feature

The View Session by period feature allows users to filter the Session List to show only those within the requested time period.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The Ui component <code>RightSideBar</code> comprises a <code>ListView</code> of 
 Session List and a title that reflects the latest filter on Session List resulting from <code>ViewSessionCommand</code>. 
 Session List's list and Ui-related operations are handled by <code>Model</code> and <code>RightSideBar</code> respectively.
</div>

The View Session mechanism is facilitated by `ViewSessionCommand` which extends `Command`. The format of the 
command is given by: 

```sview p/PERIOD```

#### 3.8.1 Implementation

When using this command, `PERIOD` should refer to either a variable period or fixed period
that returns true after running `ViewSessionCommand#isValidPeriod`. Fixed periods are found in `ViewSessionCommand#PREDICATE_HASH_MAP`, whereas variable periods
must follow the format `(+/-)#(D/W/M/Y)`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new View Session command.

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
    <p>
        <img src="images/ViewSessionActivityDiagram.png" style="height: auto;"/>
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure 22 - View Session Activity Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

In the following sequence diagram, we trace the execution when the user decides to enter the View Session command 
`sview p/week` into FitEgo.

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">

</figure>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ViewSessionCommandParser` and `ViewSessionCommand` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

1. After the user enters an input to view session for the week, the input is sent to `LogicManager` to be executed. The `AddressBookParser` identifies the command type and constructs a `ViewSessionCommandParser`.

1. The `ViewSessionCommandParser` then parses for the period and constructs a `ViewSessionCommand` with the period.

1. The `ViewSessionCommand` is returned to the `LogicManager` which will then execute it.

1. During execution of `ViewSessionCommand`, a predicate for sessions within the upcoming week is created (refer to Activity Diagram above for details on flow). The Session List in `Model` is then filtered by this predicate.

1. Command result is passed to `MainWindow` to indicate a successful execution. `MainWindow` will then update the `RightSideBar`.

    <figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; page-break-inside: avoid ">
    <p>
        <img src="images/ViewSessionUpdateRightSideBarRef.png" alt="ViewSessionUpdateRightSideBarRefSequenceDiagram" style="align-content: center" />
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure 25 - View Session Update RightSideBar Ref Sequence Diagram</figcaption>
    </figure>

1. The `RightSideBar` retrieves the latest period "WEEK" from the command result and text. `Title` is set to "WEEK". It then retrieves the filtered Session List from `LogicManager` and updates the items in `SessionListView`.

#### 3.8.2 Design Considerations

In designing this feature, we had to consider several alternative ways in which we can choose to handle viewing session by period.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Update title of `RightSideBar` based on command result.
    * Pros: Does not lower maintainability and requires the least changes to existing implementation and test code. 
    * Cons: Violates Separation of Concerns principle as `RightSideBar` has to check whether command result is from `ViewSessionCommand`.
    

* **Alternative 2:** Using Observer pattern (Observer RightSideBar, Observable Command) to update title of `RightSideBar`.
    * Pros: Reduces coupling between `Ui` and `Logic`.
    * Cons: 
        1. `RightSideBar` would only be updated when `ViewSessionCommand` is run. 
        If we set the default session view to Week when `Logic` is initialised, all sessions in existing test cases will need to start within 7 days of current date, which introduces additional complexity.
        Hence, we would not customise `RightSideBar`'s default session view.
        2. Violates YAGNI principle as making `Command` implement `Observable` interface requires addition of notify and add observer methods for all commands.
         This also increases chances of errors made in implementation.

## 5 **Appendix A: Requirements**

### 5.1 Product scope

**Target user profile**:
* is a fitness instructor who has trouble managing a significant number of clients and sessions
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* favours an All-in-One software over multiple apps
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps while appreciates a nice GUI that can show his weekly schedule
* prefers a simple and minimalistic view, as he does not like clutters.

**Value proposition**: to help a fitness instructor keeps track of his customers easily, via CLI as he’s a fast typer.
He can spend more time on his clients/his routine rather than manually using alternative software like Excel to track
administrative matters.

1. Viewing Sessions within Period while the Session List is non-empty.

   1. Prerequisites: There should be at least 1 Session in the Session List.

   1. Test case: `sview p/+1d`<br>
      Expected: The right panel only displays Sessions with start time from 0000hrs today to 2359hrs the next day. <br>
      Indication that Session List has been successfully updated is shown in the status message.

   1. Other incorrect View Session commands to try: `sview`, `sview p/+2s` (where unit of time is not d/m/y), `...` <br>
      Expected: View of Session List is unchanged. <br>
      Error details shown in the status message.
      
### 6.9 Adding a Schedule

1. Adding a Schedule while all Clients and Sessions are being shown.

   1. Prerequisites: There should be at least 1 Client and 1 Session in the Client and Session List respectively.
   
   1. Test case: `schadd c/1 s/1`<br>
      Expected: Add a Schedule associated with the first Client in the Client List and first Session in the Session List. <br>
      Details of the added Schedule are shown in the status message.
      

### 6.10 Editing a Schedule

1. Editing a Schedule while all Schedules are being shown.

   1. Prerequisites: There should be at least 1 Schedule with the associated Client and Session.

   1. Test case: `schedit c/1 s/1 us/2 pd/paid r/text`<br>
      Expected: Edit Schedule with the first Client and first Session is edited to second Session in the Session List, with payment updated to paid and remarks updated to text. <br>
      Details of the edited Schedule are shown in the status message.


### 6.11 Deleting a Schedule

1. Deleting a Schedule while all Clients and Sessions are being shown.

   1. Prerequisites: There should be at least 1 Schedule with the associated Client and Session.
   
   1. Test case: `schdel c/1 s/1`<br>
      Expected: Delete the Schedule associated with first Client in the Client List and first Session in the Session List. <br>
      Details of the deleted Schedule are shown in the status message.

### 6.12 Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Test case: Open `data/addressbook.json` and change one of the Schedule's `clientEmail` to an email that 
      does not exist inside the `clients` list. <br>
      Expected: FitEgo notices an invalid storage format and start with an empty addressbook.
      
   2. Test case: Open `data/addressbook.json` and change one of the Schedule's `startTime` or `endTime` so that the  
      resulting interval does not exist inside the Session List. <br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

## 7 **Appendix C: Efforts**
### Effort
We believe that the effort to develop FitEgo is at least twice of that of AB3. Besides new commands, we also enhanced the core of AB3 with the ability to handle modified saved file error gracefully and the ability to upload a customized picture for each Client. Other than the features, we also spent a lot of time proofreading and refining our User Guide and Developer Guide.

### Difficulty

We think that the difficulty level for developing FitEgo was quite high because there are many entities involved (Client, Session, and Schedule) compared to AB3 that only has Person. Schedule is an association class, which needs integration testing and some changes needed to be made when the Schedule-related features were added. New panels and windows such as Client List, Session List, settings window, and Client detail view were also created. Such changes in the UI were very challenging.

Our team spent about 700 hours in total (~20 hours a week) to write around 23k LoC, 30 pages of User Guide and 50 pages of Developer Guide.

### Challenges Faced 

The following were challenges encountered since the project began:

#### General 
Due to the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, we were not able to schedule weekly meet-ups for discussions, and they were replaced by weekly Zoom meetings instead. It is also harder to help other team members without meeting because we are unable to draw the solution and guide them. 

##### v1.2 
Midterms were held in the middle of milestone v1.2, resulting in some of the features being integrated nearer to the milestone’s deadline.

##### v1.4 
Iteration v1.4 is short and there were many ongoing projects from other modules, which makes the wrap up of the project challenging. While we did not have many bug reports to fix, our team is constantly looking for bugs and upgrading ourselves so that we can present the best product. 

### Achievement
Excluding the UI, we managed to achieve 81% code coverage, ensuring that our app is well-tested and bug-free. We also ensured that our User Guide and Developer Guide went above and beyond by making it more comprehensive and comprehensible to new developers.
